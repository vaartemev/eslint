# ESLint task.
1. install nodejs
1. run `npm install` in the project folder
1. add rules to `.eslintrc` file
1. run `npm start` to check rules
1. if you see `SUCCESS` at the end of the output, you can sent your solution to a mentor.

1. enforce one true brace style
1. require camel case names

1. require a comma after and on the same line **everywhere**
1. disallow padding inside computed properties
1. enforce newline at the end of file, with no multiple empty lines
1. (warn) require function expressions to have a name
1. enforce the location of arrow function bodies with implicit returns
1. use 4 spaces for indent
1. require a space before & after keywords
1. maximum line length = 80, ignore for strings and comments
1. disallow the omission of parentheses when invoking a constructor with no arguments
1. disallow mixed spaces and tabs for indentation

1. disallow multiple empty lines (more than one) and allow only one newline at the end
1. disallow use of the Object constructor
1. disallow use of unary operators, ++ and --
1. disallow `for..in` syntax and show custom error:
_"for..in loops iterate over the entire prototype chain, which is virtually never what you want. Use Object.{keys,values,entries}, and iterate over the resulting array."_
1. disallow space between function identifier and application
1. disallow tab characters entirely
1. disallow dangling underscores in identifiers **everywhere**
1. disallow a newline before a single-line statement

1. require space before blocks
1. require space before opening parenthesis in anonymous and arrow functions. Exception: named functions.
1. disallow spaces inside parentheses
1. require spaces around operators
1. Require spaces before/after 'words' unary operators (new, delete, typeof, void, yield), disallow space before/after 'nonwords' operators (-, +, --, ++, !, !!).
